In ICP 2: 5 functions were made: 
          star()- creates a design using the "*" and for loop
          oddindices()- prints all odd indices in a list using a for loop
          listType() - prints a new list containing all the datatypes of the given elements in a list
          uniquelist() - prints a new list containing 1 of each distinct list element
          countcases() - prints the number of upper and lower case letters in a list while ignoring spaces

In ICP3 programs were made in numpy to:

          create a randomized array, make it a 3,5 shape, and replace max values with 0\
          calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given array
          calculate the sum of the diagonal values of an array
          write a program to reshape an array without changing data
          
programs in pandas were made to:
          
          translate a csv to pandas graph
          show a summary of the data
          check if it had null values and replace them with the mean
          select 2 columns and agregate them with min, max, count, and mean.
          filter the dataframe to show rows with calories between 500 and 1000
          filter the dataframe to show rows with calories>500 and pulse>100
          copy the dataframe excluding the maxpulse column
          remove the maxpulse column
          convert calories' datatype to int
